========================

OSChanger isan application written in Visual Basic that allows for a Bootable USB that uses GRUB4DOS to be transformed
into a powerful Drive capable of Installing Multiple Operating Systems.

All the instructions for operating the program are found in the help.html file accesible from the "?" Button in the
middle of the Program.

To install the program on a Drive, first install grub on it then run the Setup (requires WinRaR) and extract the files
to the root of the said USB Drive or hardware.

Basically what the program does is it allows to quickly create menu entries for the Linux ISOs, as well as delete them
when you remove the ISOs, without having to manually edit the Menu LIST

As for Windows, it does the same thing, and solves the problem of only being possible to Install a single Windows from
a USB by moving the files from the root to a storage folder, where they await further use, thus allowing another one to
be moved there and allowing installation.

We know this is an early stage, this is the most one coder can do in a day and a half. I will continue to add features
and fool-proofing the program. Until then, we hope you will find it useful.

Thank you.
